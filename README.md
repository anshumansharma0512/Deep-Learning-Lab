EXPERIMENT-1: MNIST Hand written text classification using ANN.
EXPERIMENT-2: Observation of the MNIST dataset classification model with hidden layer and without the hidden layer. 
EXPERIMENT-3: Implement CNN to classify images in the Cats vs Dogs dataset and the CIFAR-10 dataset using hyper parameter tuning find out the best possible combination of 3 optimizers, 3 weight initilialization techniques and 3 activation functions. Further fine tuning with the ResNet-18 architecture and comparing it with the best model found in the experimentation.
